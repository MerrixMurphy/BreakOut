# BreakOut

## Current Status: Refactor

 A puzzle game currently in development using Kotlin in Android Studio. I put the project on hold due to lack of level ideas and, more importantly, I wanted to redo it after finishing schooling so that I can clean everything up more.
 
 This will be an actual release eventually to the Google Play store so I do not wish to give anything else away yet, but this will be updated with the project later.
